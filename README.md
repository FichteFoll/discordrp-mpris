discordrp-mpris provides Rich Presence to Discord clients
based on music or other media that you are playing
and that is exposed through the [mpris2][] D-Bus interface.
Thus, it only works on systems where D-Bus is available
and *not* on Windows.

discordrp-mpris is intended to run in the background
alongside your local Discord client
and your media player(s).
Multiple media players are supported
and the ones with active playback are prioritized.
The most recently active player will then be followed
until it is no longer playing
and a different player starts playback.

This project is in *beta* stage.
